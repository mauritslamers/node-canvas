so:

install_name_tool -change old_ref new_ref filename 

will replace a hardcoded absolute path with a relative one.
The only thing to do now is to find out which path is actually included when compiling
(why isn't the ./usr/local/lib/libcanvas.2.dylib not taken instead of the Cellar one)
and then replace it after building is done.
